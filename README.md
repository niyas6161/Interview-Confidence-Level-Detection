Interview confidence level detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe with a Haar cascade file involves analyzing facial expressions and gestures to gauge the interviewee's confidence. OpenCV provides tools for image processing, while MediaPipe offers pre-trained models for facial landmark detection. The Haar cascade file is utilized to detect facial features like eyes, eyebrows, and mouth. By tracking these features' movements and analyzing their positions and expressions, the system can infer the interviewee's confidence level. For instance, raised eyebrows and a relaxed mouth may indicate confidence, while fidgeting or averting eye contact may suggest nervousness. The system processes live video input from a webcam, detects facial landmarks using MediaPipe, and then applies the Haar cascade file to identify relevant facial features. Finally, it analyzes these features' configurations to determine the confidence level, providing valuable feedback for interviewers. This project leverages the power of computer vision to enhance the interview process, enabling objective assessment of non-verbal cues.

step includes:
   1) Facial Detection: OpenCV is used to detect faces in the video stream or image. This step ensures that the system focuses on the relevant facial features for analysis.

   2) Facial Landmark Detection: MediaPipe is employed to detect facial landmarks such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth. These landmarks help in understanding facial expressions and gestures.

   3) Feature Extraction: Relevant features such as eye contact, smiling, nodding, and facial expressions are extracted from the detected facial landmarks.

   4) Confidence Level Analysis: Based on predefined criteria (e.g., eye contact duration, frequency of smiling), the system assesses the interviewee's confidence level. For instance, maintaining eye contact, smiling, and positive facial expressions          may indicate high confidence, while avoiding eye contact or displaying nervous gestures may suggest lower confidence.

   5) Feedback or Scoring: Depending on the confidence level detected, the system may provide real-time feedback to the interviewee or assign a confidence score. This feedback can be used for self-improvement or as an assessment tool for interview            performance.
